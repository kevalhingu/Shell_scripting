# Variables and Data Types

## Declaring and Using Variables

In shell scripting, variables are used to store and manipulate data. Variable names are case-sensitive, and it is good practice to use uppercase letters for constant values and lowercase or mixed-case letters for variable names.

### Declaring Variables

Variables can be declared using the following syntax:

```bash
variable_name=value
```
For example:
```bash
name="Keval"
age=20
```
