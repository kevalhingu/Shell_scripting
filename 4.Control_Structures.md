# Control Structures

In shell scripting, control structures enable you to make decisions, repeat tasks, and handle different scenarios. This guide covers the following control structures:

1. [Conditional Statements (if-else)](#conditional-statements-if-else)
2. [Loops (for, while)](#loops-for-while)
3. [Case Statements](#case-statements)

## Conditional Statements (if-else)

Conditional statements allow you to execute different sets of commands based on certain conditions. The basic syntax for an if-else statement is as follows:

```bash
if [ condition ]; then
    # commands to execute if the condition is true
else
    # commands to execute if the condition is false
fi
```
### Example 1: Simple if-else Statement
```bash
#!/bin/bash

age=20

if [ $age -ge 18 ]; then
    echo "You are eligible to vote."
else
    echo "You are not eligible to vote yet."
fi
```
In this example, the script checks if the variable age is greater than or equal to 18 and prints a message accordingly.

## Loops (for, while)
Loops allow you to repeat a set of commands multiple times. There are different types of loops, such as for and while loops.

## For Loop
The for loop iterates over a sequence of values. The basic syntax is as follows:
```bash
for variable in value1 value2 ... valuen; do
    # commands to execute for each value
done
```
### Example 2: For Loop to Print Numbers
```bash
#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..5}; do
    echo "Number: $i"
done
```
This script uses a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.

## While Loop
The while loop continues executing commands as long as a specified condition is true. The basic syntax is as follows:

```bash
while [ condition ]; do
    # commands to execute as long as the condition is true
done
```
### Example 3: While Loop to Count Down
```bash
#!/bin/bash

count=5

while [ $count -gt 0 ]; do
    echo "Countdown: $count"
    ((count--))
done
```
This script uses a while loop to count down from 5 to 1.

## Case Statements
Case statements provide a way to perform different actions based on the value of a variable. The basic syntax is as follows:
```bash
case variable in
    pattern1)
        # commands for pattern1
        ;;
    pattern2)
        # commands for pattern2
        ;;
    *)
        # commands for any other pattern
        ;;
esac
```
### Example 4: Case Statement for Day of the Week
```bash
#!/bin/bash

day="Monday"

case $day in
    "Monday"|"Tuesday"|"Wednesday"|"Thursday"|"Friday")
        echo "It's a weekday."
        ;;
    "Saturday"|"Sunday")
        echo "It's a weekend."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Invalid day."
        ;;
esac
```
This script uses a case statement to determine whether a given day is a weekday or weekend.

These examples illustrate the usage of control structures in shell scripting. Feel free to modify and experiment with the provided code.

# Key Takeaways
- **Conditional Statements:** Use if, elif, and else for decision-making based on conditions.
- **Loops:** Use for and while loops for repetitive tasks.
- **Case Statements:** Use case for multiple condition matching.
